#### Introduction
Welcome to coolblog - the ultimate platform for expressing your thoughts and ideas through blogs! With Blogify, you can create, publish, and search for blogs effortlessly.

#### Requirements
1. **Single Page Application**: Blogify is built as a single-page application using create-react-app.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilizes at least 5 components to maintain a well-organized codebase.
3. **Client-Side Routing**: Implements at least 3 client-side routes using [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), allowing seamless navigation between different sections of the app.
4. **Backend API Integration**: Integrates with a JSON server to create a RESTful API for handling backend operations. Supports both GET and POST requests to fetch and add blogs, respectively. Incorporates a controlled form/component for posting blogs.
5. **Styling**: Employs custom CSS or a UI framework like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to add aesthetic appeal and enhance user experience.
